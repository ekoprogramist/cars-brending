        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Mercedes-Benz is a legendary brand of German auto giant Daimler AG. As
          a result of an insatiable search for innovation, Mercedes-Benz has
          become the world's first automobile brand, which means a comfortable,
          sustainable and stylish car. Today, under the Mercedes-Benz trademark,
          a wide range of vehicles are produced: passenger cars,
          passenger/military light all-terrain vehicles, trucks, buses,
          mini-vans, etc. The brand name - "Mercedes-Benz" was born in 1926 by
          the merger of two brands - Mercedes (Daimler-Engine Company DMG) and
          Benz (Benz and Benz & Co.). Initially, "Daimler Motors Society",
          founded in 1890, did not sell its cars under the name of Mercedes. The
          origin of Mercedes as a brand name is connected with the businessman
          Emil Ellinec, the latter has been dealing with Daimler cars since
          1898. In 1888, Emil Elenik took part in car races held in Nice under
          the pseudonym "Mercedes" (in honor of his daughter Adriana Manuela
          Ramona Elinek, who was fondly called Mercedes). However, at that time
          "Mercedes" was not used as a car name, but only as a driver's name. In
          1900, Elinek reached an agreement with the Daimler Motor Company to
          create a new, more powerful engine model that would be named
          Mercedes-Daimler. It was at this time that "Mercedes" was used as a
          product name. At the same time, Eleniki became a Daimler distributor
          and ordered 36 cars for a total of 550,001 marks (about 3 million
          euros at today's exchange rate), later he ordered an additional 36
          cars from Daimler, which were equipped with 8-horsepower engines.
          After that, since 1901, "Mercedes-automobiles" (this name was already
          used not only for the driver, but also for the cars) successfully
          participated in the car races held in Nice, which spread the
          recognition factor of Mercedes on a much wider scale. Finally, Daimler
          Motors Corporation copyrighted the Mercedes brand name in 1902. The
          registration of the famous symbol of the brand - the star - took place
          in 1909. In 1926, through the mediation of "Deutsche-Bank",
          "Daimler-Motorsociety" and its competitor "Benz & Company" merged, as
          a result of which "Daimler-Benz Autocorporation" was created, it is
          with this date that the origin of "Mercedes-Benz" as a brand name is
          connected. It should also be noted that if the famous cars of Mercedes
          might have had a different name without Elinec, without Berta Benz
          (Ringer before marriage) they might not have been created at all. At
          the age of 22, this clever young lady demanded a dowry from her father
          and invested all the money in the metallurgical and machine-building
          enterprise of Carl Benz and August Ritter. A year later, Bertha
          married Karl Benz. One morning in August 1888, without asking her
          husband, Frau Benz took out her self-propelled carriage (it is true
          that at that time this carriage had already received an award at the
          Munich exhibition, but people still saw it as a kind of entertainment
          and saw no excuse for practical use in it) and went to visit her
          mother. His mother lived 106 kilometers away from their home. Berta
          took two sons with her. No one had traveled such a long distance in a
          self-propelled wheelchair before. Berta Benz's journey was a success.
          The cart caused a real furor. Soon everyone was talking about Benz's
          invention and orders for the production of new cars were arranged. In
          1893, 25 Motorwagen cars were sold, and later the Velo model appeared.
          In short, Carl Benz's business developed successfully thanks to his
          intelligent wife. Today, the Mercedes Museum is located in the German
          city of Stuttgart, where the interested visitor can see the history of
          Mercedes-Benz starting with the world's first car - "Motorwagen" and
          ending with the legendary "Silberpfeil".
