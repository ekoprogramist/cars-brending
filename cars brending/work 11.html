        <h2>History of establishment</h2>
        <p>
          July 21, 1917 is considered the official date of establishment of the
          company, although the history of "Beemve" began several years earlier.
          In 1913, two small firms appeared in Munich, headed by Karl Rapp and
          Gustav Otto (the son of Nikolaus Otto, who created the internal
          combustion engine). The mentioned two firms were forced to merge
          during the First World War and began to produce aircraft engines. In
          1916, the company changed its name to "Bairische Motoren Werke". In
          1917, the "Beemve" emblem was also developed - the symbol of a
          rotating propeller. In the same year, the chief engineer of the
          company, Max Fritz, created a 6-cylinder aviation engine - Tour-3A,
          and then - Motor-4, with which Franz Diemer set a world record in high
          jump in 1919, when he climbed 9,670 meters into the sky. Max Fritz
          also showed insight in 1918, when the Treaty of Versailles banned the
          production of aircraft engines. Beemwe was on the verge of bankruptcy,
          but Max started producing motorcycles. He released the R-32, the
          serial production of which began in 1923 and soon became popular. Five
          years later, the company acquired a small car manufacturing plant in
          the town of Eisenach (Germany), which had been producing miniature
          Dixies since 1904. According to the contract, the factory launched
          "Austin Dix" brand cars. The new Dixie was in great demand. That's why
          Beemve has been producing this model for a very long time. In 1932,
          the company launched its own car. It was a model 3210 that had an
          originally designed engine. Its power was 20 horsepower, and its speed
          was 80 km/h. For the first time, it was Beemwe-303 that installed a
          convex metal grid in front of the radiator (Beemwe is still proud of
          this design element) and its speed was 90 km/h. After launching
          several models of sports cars, the management of "Beemwe" decided to
          produce high-class cars as well. The designers soon achieved their
          goal and released the Beemwe-326, which even competed with
          Mercedes-Benz. Due to high demand, 16,000 such models were produced.
          By 1936, the company presented the first valuable sports car -
          two-seater roadster-328. This car was specially designed to
          participate in the then very popular Mille Miglia race. Beemwe-328
          clearly fulfilled its "duty" in 1940, when this model covered a
          thousand miles in record time (166.7 km/h). Along with the development
          of automobile production, motorcycles also developed. In 1937, Ernst
          Hahn broke the world record with a Beemwe motorcycle, when he
          developed a speed of 279.5 km/h. After Germany's defeat in World War
          II, several of Beemwe's factories were affected and it faced
          bankruptcy. Therefore, "Beemve" switched back to the production of
          motorcycles. Since 1951, the production of a new model of Beemwe has
          started. The Beemwe-501 stood out from the models in its class in
          terms of comfort, but it was quite heavy and its engine had a hard
          time carrying the weight of the vehicle. Three years later, the
          designers created an 8-cylinder engine that suited the 501 well. The
          car was developing 160 km/h. By 1955, the company created a rather
          strange model - the Yesta. It had one door and a 13-horsepower engine,
          developed only 80 km/h, but due to its low price, it aroused great
          interest in the public. Later, Beemwe created luxury sports models -
          503 and 507. Certain defects were found in the cars. It was leaked
          that the company was facing a financial crisis after World War II.
          Therefore, Daimler-Benz wanted to buy shares of BMW, but the company
          decided to earn money without the help of others to create a new
          model. In 1961, a new cheap but comfortable sedan was created with a
          1.4-liter engine. The price and convenience have had a proper effect
          on the customer. As a result, the company received an order for 20,000
          pieces at once. Thus began another rise of Beemwe. In 1966, the
          company introduced the new Beemwe-2000. This model formed the basis
          for the release of the third series of Beemways. Soon the fifth series
          Beemwe was created. In the late 1970s, the sixth and seventh series
          cars were released in a row. The fourth generation of BMW-3 sedans
          with the factory index - E30 was produced from November 1982 to the
          end of 1991. This was a well-known "hooliganka" in Georgia. In this
          model, the driver and the passenger sitting next to him enjoy maximum
          comfort in the car and in general in Beemwe. For many years, Beemwe's
          dashboard design has been a benchmark for many automakers. In 2006,
          Beemwe entered Formula One competitions for the first time.
