            <p><b>From 1910 to 1969
                In early 1909, after a disagreement with the first Horch-Werke factory, August Horch changed the name of his automobile factory to Audi Automobil-Werke. By mid-1910, his first car, the Audi, was on the market. This car was equipped with a 2.6-liter four-cylinder engine with a capacity of 22 hp.
               
                In 1920, Audi Automobil-Werke AG introduced the new trademark Audi. In keeping with the fashionable business style of the time, the ornate outline of Lucian Bernhard was replaced by the Audi emblem. Audi Automobil-Werke logo taken from an AG model in 1920
               
                Now a new emblem (golden oval letters on a blue background) adorned the Audi radiators. When the first post-war Audi hit the market in 1965, it had this trademark on the right front "wing" and the rear of the body
               
                After the creation of the company Auto Union GmbH, in September 1949, in Ingolstadt, the production of motorcycles and cars intended for the transportation of small batches of luggage began. In August 1950, the production of DKW began.

                Until the end of 1961, DKW passenger cars were produced at Rheinmetall-B or sing AG's production facilities in Düsseldorf.

                From 1969 to the present day
                With the start of the production series NSU in 1977 as an additional trademark quality, a red-brown oval was introduced as Audi's typeface. Since 1982, the signature oval has also decorated the side surfaces of the car's "wings".
               
                In October 1994, the oval Audi logo was replaced by a combination of four rings and a typeface, which was already done in red.
               
                In the early 1970s, large-scale Audi exports to the United States began. Initially, exports were limited to the Audi Super 90 (sedan and station wagon), as well as the new Audi 100. From 1973, they were joined by the Audi 80, which, unlike its European version, came out with a station wagon body. Audi later adopted its own designation for the US market: Audi 4000 for Audi 80, Audi 5000 for Audi 100. The 1984 Audi 90 was intended for the US market only. Analogue of this model was Audi 80.

            <p>Ferdinand Piech in Audi
                With its new birth, the Audi brand has to thank Ferdinand Piech, the grandson of the famous Ferdinand Porsche. A talented designer, Pich headed Audi's promising inventions department in 1972. It was he who started working on the creation of Audi all-wheel drive passenger cars.
               
                In these cars, the power of the car on the road was transferred to both sides of the car, front and back - in a ratio of 50/50. In case of lack of traction, the torque of the front or rear wheels would "jump" to the wheels that had the best grip on the road. Such a scheme allowed to fully use the potential of the engine.
               
                Shortly thereafter, Pich enthusiastically supported the use of aluminum in the production of Audi cars. Such forward-thinking technical innovations brought him a name. Indeed, Ferdinand Pich's talent was not limited to technology - he made no less daring decisions in the field of marketing. For example, Pich was able to convince his colleagues that Audi needed to change its position in the market. Ferdinand Pich had a dizzying career at Audi: in 1988 he was elected a member of the management of Audi AG, and in 1993 he became the head of the Volkswagen AG concern, which was headed by his grandfather. Pich led VW until 2002.

            <h3>System Quattro's make</h3>
            <p>In March 1980, Audi's stand at the Geneva Motor Show became a real sensation, thanks to the presentation of an all-wheel drive sports coupe. For the first time, a passenger car was presented with the all-wheel drive concept, which was previously only used in trucks and SUVs. The first generation Audi 100 became the most expensive model and gave the impetus for further progress in the premium segment. The idea of ​​such a light vehicle arose in the winter of 1976-77, when the VW Iltis military all-terrain vehicle was being tested. The excellent performance of this car in snow and ice gave rise to the idea to use the VW Iltis wheel drive system in the Audi 80. In the same year, research and design work was carried out, the result of which was the creation of the sports Audi quattro.

                All-wheel drive system Audi received the name Quattro. Ingolstadt realized that quattro is not just a technical term, but an independent brand that can serve as a "locomotive" in the development of the Audi brand. Later, even a separate direction in production was created - Quattro GmbH, which served to advance Audi's signature style: clothes, souvenirs, accessories.
               
                In 1995, Quattro GmbH took over the tuning of Audi models, and later began the production of sports car modifications. Today, the fastest and most extreme versions of Audi are assembled at the Quattro GmbH factory.
               
                In order to show the world the advantages of all-wheel drive cars, Audi started participating in the World Rally Championship.
               
                The Audi quattro made its sports debut in early 1981 at the January race in Austria. The Audi quattro all-wheel drive suspension revolutionized the world of international rallying and racing. In December 1982, serial production of the Audi 80 quattro with all-wheel drive began.
               
                The Audi Sport Quattro revolutionized rallying, proving the efficiency of all-wheel drive.
               
                Gradually, the quattro system was offered on other Audi models as well. Victories in this competition, in 1983-1984, allowed to complete the installation of the quattro system on production cars, which is no less important. Potential customers formed an opinion on Audi as a solid brand. This was the first step towards getting rid of the "people's car" image.

            <h2>Models history</h2>
            <p>The racing success of the Audi Sport Quattro led to the market success of the Audi 80 quattro model, which also received the signature all-wheel drive system.

                At the Geneva Motor Show in March 1990, Audi AG presented the Audi duo, the serial Audi 100 Avant quattro, in which, in addition to the conventional gasoline engine, there was also an electric motor for the rear wheels. If necessary, the drive could be switched from a gasoline engine to an electric one. This hybrid vehicle was intended for utility use.
               
                In December 1990, the new Audi 100 (internally C4) was presented, which was also offered with a six-cylinder V-type engine for the first time in the history of the concern. The powerful (174 hp) unit with a volume of 2.8 liters was the most compact and lightest in its class. It had a new gasoline delivery system that provided high pulling power at low revs and high power in the upper rev range.
               
                However, despite the all-wheel drive and success in the rally, Audi was not able to capture the upper echelons of the car market and stand in one row with BMW and Mercedes. Higher caste required more. After Pich took the post of the head of the Volkswagen concern, the active repositioning of the Audi brand began.
               
                In 1990, for the first time, the Audi 100 received a powerful and compact V6 engine.
               
                At first they switched to selling Volkswagen and Audi separately. Until 1993, cars of this brand were sold under one roof. VW management requested the construction of separate sales points for Audi.
               
                The marketing of VW dealers, as before, was largely based on creating financially acceptable conditions for the customer, while potential Audi buyers began to be attracted by special service offers.
               
                The fictitious "breakup" with Volkswagen required Audi to expand its model line. Until 1994, the company released only two models: Audi 80 and Audi 100. In 1994, Audi А8, an all-wheel-drive sedan of the representative class, was launched. The market received the car rather restrainedly, but in turn "illuminated" the Audi brand in high circles.
